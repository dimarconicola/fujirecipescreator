# Fuji Recipe Lab Documentation

This folder is the canonical documentation set for product, engineering, QA, and research decisions.

## Documents

1. `research/source-validation-2026-02-16.md`
Purpose: validates external links/resources and records what is confirmed vs uncertain.

2. `research/asset-licensing-checklist.md`
Purpose: pre-implementation legal checklist and manifest template for image/LUT asset intake.

3. `research/resource-sourcing-2026-02-16.md`
Purpose: resource sourcing log with concrete downloaded assets and pending legal/manual items.

4. `product/requirements-v1.md`
Purpose: consolidated product requirements for MVP, based on project specs and validated constraints.

5. `engineering/implementation-plan-v1.md`
Purpose: architecture, phased execution strategy, quality gates, and delivery plan.

6. `engineering/mvp-backlog.md`
Purpose: prioritized implementation backlog linked to requirement IDs and critical path sequencing.

7. `engineering/next-iteration-backlog.md`
Purpose: prioritized post-audit implementation backlog with owners, effort, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

8. `engineering/technical-spec.md`
Purpose: exact as-built technical specification for architecture, contracts, runtime behavior, and known constraints.

9. `engineering/renderer-contract-v1.md`
Purpose: renderer truth-model decision record (NI-007) and LUT/procedural contract boundaries.

## Documentation Rules

1. External claims must be tied to source URLs and date-checked.
2. Product and engineering docs should reference requirement IDs.
3. Do not start implementation work without a matching requirement and acceptance criteria.
4. Legal/licensing assumptions must be marked explicitly as either `verified` or `pending`.

## Status

Current state: implementation in progress, with active stabilization/hardening backlog.
